The speed limit governor is a droop governor where the speed limit value defines the speed at the maximum torque available during this operation.  If a device wants to know whether it has access to the engine, there are several possibilities:  a. Comparing its command with the actual engine broadcasts. b. Looking at command modes from other devices. c. Looking to the engine and retarder torque mode.  Remarks:  a. The realization of a torque limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the speed limit to a high value (0xFAFF). b. The realization of a speed limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the torque limit to a high value (0xFA). c. Limiting the retarder torque means to limit the magnitude of the torque request.  As the brake torque is represented by negative torque values, the limitation must be done by a maximum selection of the requested torque and the retarder internal torque signals. d. For torque increasing functions, time limits for the torque or speed value (command) and the direct modes are desirable.  e. The selection of which device has control of the engine's speed or torque depends on the override mode priority (see SPN 897) with the highest priority device gaining control.  In the case of two devices with identical priority, the engine responds to speed/torque control commands over speed/torque limit commands and will act on the speed or torque commands on a first come, first served basis.  The torque limit will be a “lowest wins” selection (e.g., if one device commands 60% limit and another 80% limit, then the engine will limit torque to 60%).

Requested torque to the engine is measured in indicated torque as a percentage of reference engine torque (see the engine configuration message, PGN 65251).  This is the engine torque at which the engine is expected to operate if the torque control mode is active or the engine torque which the engine is not expected to exceed if the torque limit mode is active.  Zero torque can be requested which implies zero fuel and, according to Figures SPN512_A and SPN512_B, the engine will not be allowed to stall.  The actual engine percent torque (SPN 513) should be zero and the engine should decelerate until the low idle governor kicks in, at which time the actual engine percent torque will be calculated as shown in Figures SPN512_A and SPN512_B and the engine torque mode bits (SPN 899) should be equal to 0000b - Low Idle Governor.  Requested torque to the retarder is measured in indicated torque as a percentage of reference retarder torque (see the retarder configuration message,  PGN 65249).  The logic used in enabling or disabling the retarder is based on the override control mode priority bits (SPN 897).  A zero torque request to the retarder is a disable request, and is used by a J1939 node to prevent the retarder from being activated by other combinations of inputs outside of J1939 commands. The Torque Limit Mode is commonly used for this purpose.|1 byte|1 %/bit|-125 %|-125 to 125 %|0 to 125% engine torque requests, -125% to 0% for retarder torque requests|%

The speed limit governor is a droop governor where the speed limit value defines the speed at the maximum torque available during this operation.  If a device wants to know whether it has access to the engine, there are several possibilities:  a. Comparing its command with the actual engine broadcasts. b. Looking at command modes from other devices. c. Looking to the engine and retarder torque mode.  Remarks:  a. The realization of a torque limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the speed limit to a high value (0xFAFF). b. The realization of a speed limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the torque limit to a high value (0xFA). c. Limiting the retarder torque means to limit the magnitude of the torque request.  As the brake torque is represented by negative torque values, the limitation must be done by a maximum selection of the requested torque and the retarder internal torque signals. d. For torque increasing functions, time limits for the torque or speed value (command) and the direct modes are desirable.  e. The selection of which device has control of the engine's speed or torque depends on the override mode priority (see SPN 897) with the highest priority device gaining control.  In the case of two devices with identical priority, the engine responds to speed/torque control commands over speed/torque limit commands and will act on the speed or torque commands on a first come, first served basis.  The torque limit will be a “lowest wins” selection (e.g., if one device commands 60% limit and another 80% limit, then the engine will limit torque to 60%).  Figure SPN695_A provides a flowchart of the torque/speed control priority selection logic.|2 bits|4 states/2 bit|0|0 to 3||bit

The default is 11 (Low priority).  It is not required to use the same priority during the entire override function.  For example, the transmission can use priority 01 (High priority) during a shift, but can set the priority to 11 (Low priority) at the end of the shift to allow traction control to also interact with the torque limit of the engine.  The four priority levels defined are:  00 Highest priority 01 High priority 10 Medium priority 11 Low priority  00b - Highest Priority = Used for situations that require immediate action by the receiving device in order to provide safe vehicle operation (i.e., braking systems).  This level of priority should only be used in safety critical conditions.  01b -  High Priority  =  Used for control situations that require prompt action in order to provide safe vehicle operation.  An example is when the transmission is performing a shift and requires control of the engine in order to control driveline reengagement.  10b - Medium Priority = Used for powertrain control operations which are related to assuring that the vehicle is in a stable operating condition.  An example is when the traction control system is commanding the engine in order to achieve traction stability.  11b - Low Priority = Used to indicate that the associated command desires powertrain control but is needed for function which improves the driver comfort which may be overridden by other devices.

The default is 11 (Low priority).  It is not required to use the same priority during the entire override function.  For example, the transmission can use priority 01 (High priority) during a shift, but can set the priority to 11 (Low priority) at the end of the shift to allow traction control to also interact with the torque limit of the engine.  The four priority levels defined are:  00 Highest priority 01 High priority 10 Medium priority 11 Low priority  00b - Highest Priority = Used for situations that require immediate action by the receiving device in order to provide safe vehicle operation (i.e., braking systems).  This level of priority should only be used in safety critical conditions.  01b -  High Priority  =  Used for control situations that require prompt action in order to provide safe vehicle operation.  An example is when the transmission is performing a shift and requires control of the engine in order to control driveline reengagement.  10b - Medium Priority = Used for powertrain control operations which are related to assuring that the vehicle is in a stable operating condition.  An example is when the traction control system is commanding the engine in order to achieve traction stability.  11b - Low Priority = Used to indicate that the associated command desires powertrain control but is needed for function which improves the driver comfort which may be overridden by other devices.  An example is cruise control or the non-critical part of a transmission shift to a new gear.|2 bits|4 states/2 bit|0|0 to 3||bit

Requested torque to the engine is measured in indicated torque as a percentage of reference engine torque (see the engine configuration message, PGN 65251).  This is the engine torque at which the engine is expected to operate if the torque control mode is active or the engine torque which the engine is not expected to exceed if the torque limit mode is active.  Zero torque can be requested which implies zero fuel and, according to Figures SPN512_A and SPN512_B, the engine will not be allowed to stall.  The actual engine percent torque (SPN 513) should be zero and the engine should decelerate until the low idle governor kicks in, at which time the actual engine percent torque will be calculated as shown in Figures SPN512_A and SPN512_B and the engine torque mode bits (SPN 899) should be equal to 0000b - Low Idle Governor.  Requested torque to the retarder is measured in indicated torque as a percentage of reference retarder torque (see the retarder configuration message,  PGN 65249).  The logic used in enabling or disabling the retarder is based on the override control mode priority bits (SPN 897).  A zero torque request to the retarder is a disable request, and is used by a J1939 node to prevent the retarder from being activated by other combinations of inputs outside of J1939 commands.

The speed limit governor is a droop governor where the speed limit value defines the speed at the maximum torque available during this operation.  If a device wants to know whether it has access to the engine, there are several possibilities:  a. Comparing its command with the actual engine broadcasts. b. Looking at command modes from other devices. c. Looking to the engine and retarder torque mode.  Remarks:  a. The realization of a torque limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the speed limit to a high value (0xFAFF). b. The realization of a speed limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the torque limit to a high value (0xFA). c. Limiting the retarder torque means to limit the magnitude of the torque request.  As the brake torque is represented by negative torque values, the limitation must be done by a maximum selection of the requested torque and the retarder internal torque signals. d. For torque increasing functions, time limits for the torque or speed value (command) and the direct modes are desirable.  e. The selection of which device has control of the engine's speed or torque depends on the override mode priority (see SPN 897) with the highest priority device gaining control.  In the case of two devices with identical priority, the engine responds to speed/torque control commands over speed/torque limit commands and will act on the speed or torque commands on a first come, first served basis.  The torque limit will be a “lowest wins” selection (e.g., if one device commands 60% limit and another 80% limit, then the engine will limit torque to 60%).  Figure SPN695_A provides a flowchart of the torque/speed control priority selection logic.|2 bits|4 states/2 bit|0|0 to 3||bit

The speed limit governor is a droop governor where the speed limit value defines the speed at the maximum torque available during this operation.  If a device wants to know whether it has access to the engine, there are several possibilities:  a. Comparing its command with the actual engine broadcasts. b. Looking at command modes from other devices. c. Looking to the engine and retarder torque mode.  Remarks:  a. The realization of a torque limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the speed limit to a high value (0xFAFF). b. The realization of a speed limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the torque limit to a high value (0xFA). c. Limiting the retarder torque means to limit the magnitude of the torque request.  As the brake torque is represented by negative torque values, the limitation must be done by a maximum selection of the requested torque and the retarder internal torque signals. d. For torque increasing functions, time limits for the torque or speed value (command) and the direct modes are desirable.  e. The selection of which device has control of the engine's speed or torque depends on the override mode priority (see SPN 897) with the highest priority device gaining control.  In the case of two devices with identical priority, the engine responds to speed/torque control commands over speed/torque limit commands and will act on the speed or torque commands on a first come, first served basis.  The torque limit will be a “lowest wins” selection (e.g., if one device commands 60% limit and another 80% limit, then the engine will limit torque to 60%).  Figure SPN695_A provides a flowchart of the torque/speed control priority selection logic.|2 bits|4 states/2 bit|0|0 to 3||bit

For instance, the more complex plant would contain the engine, its accessory loads and the driveline characteristics.  As an example, the driveline characteristics might include the effective spring mass relationship of pumps, tires, clutches, axles, driveshafts, and multiple gear ratios.

The default is 11 (Low priority).  It is not required to use the same priority during the entire override function.  For example, the transmission can use priority 01 (High priority) during a shift, but can set the priority to 11 (Low priority) at the end of the shift to allow traction control to also interact with the torque limit of the engine.  The four priority levels defined are:  00 Highest priority 01 High priority 10 Medium priority 11 Low priority  00b - Highest Priority = Used for situations that require immediate action by the receiving device in order to provide safe vehicle operation (i.e., braking systems).  This level of priority should only be used in safety critical conditions.  01b -  High Priority  =  Used for control situations that require prompt action in order to provide safe vehicle operation.  An example is when the transmission is performing a shift and requires control of the engine in order to control driveline reengagement.  10b - Medium Priority = Used for powertrain control operations which are related to assuring that the vehicle is in a stable operating condition.  An example is when the traction control system is commanding the engine in order to achieve traction stability.  11b - Low Priority = Used to indicate that the associated command desires powertrain control but is needed for function which improves the driver comfort which may be overridden by other devices.  An example is cruise control or the non-critical part of a transmission shift to a new gear.|2 bits|4 states/2 bit|0|0 to 3||bit

This is the engine torque at which the engine is expected to operate if the torque control mode is active or the engine torque which the engine is not expected to exceed if the torque limit mode is active.  Zero torque can be requested which implies zero fuel and, according to Figures SPN512_A and SPN512_B, the engine will not be allowed to stall.  The actual engine percent torque (SPN 513) should be zero and the engine should decelerate until the low idle governor kicks in, at which time the actual engine percent torque will be calculated as shown in Figures SPN512_A and SPN512_B and the engine torque mode bits (SPN 899) should be equal to 0000b - Low Idle Governor.  Requested torque to the retarder is measured in indicated torque as a percentage of reference retarder torque (see the retarder configuration message,  PGN 65249).  The logic used in enabling or disabling the retarder is based on the override control mode priority bits (SPN 897).  A zero torque request to the retarder is a disable request, and is used by a J1939 node to prevent the retarder from being activated by other combinations of inputs outside of J1939 commands.

Requested torque to the engine is measured in indicated torque as a percentage of reference engine torque (see the engine configuration message, PGN 65251).  This is the engine torque at which the engine is expected to operate if the torque control mode is active or the engine torque which the engine is not expected to exceed if the torque limit mode is active.  Zero torque can be requested which implies zero fuel and, according to Figures SPN512_A and SPN512_B, the engine will not be allowed to stall.  The actual engine percent torque (SPN 513) should be zero and the engine should decelerate until the low idle governor kicks in, at which time the actual engine percent torque will be calculated as shown in Figures SPN512_A and SPN512_B and the engine torque mode bits (SPN 899) should be equal to 0000b - Low Idle Governor.  Requested torque to the retarder is measured in indicated torque as a percentage of reference retarder torque (see the retarder configuration message,  PGN 65249).  The logic used in enabling or disabling the retarder is based on the override control mode priority bits (SPN 897).  A zero torque request to the retarder is a disable request, and is used by a J1939 node to prevent the retarder from being activated by other combinations of inputs outside of J1939 commands.

Requested torque to the engine is measured in indicated torque as a percentage of reference engine torque (see the engine configuration message, PGN 65251).  This is the engine torque at which the engine is expected to operate if the torque control mode is active or the engine torque which the engine is not expected to exceed if the torque limit mode is active.  Zero torque can be requested which implies zero fuel and, according to Figures SPN512_A and SPN512_B, the engine will not be allowed to stall.  The actual engine percent torque (SPN 513) should be zero and the engine should decelerate until the low idle governor kicks in, at which time the actual engine percent torque will be calculated as shown in Figures SPN512_A and SPN512_B and the engine torque mode bits (SPN 899) should be equal to 0000b - Low Idle Governor.  Requested torque to the retarder is measured in indicated torque as a percentage of reference retarder torque (see the retarder configuration message,  PGN 65249).  The logic used in enabling or disabling the retarder is based on the override control mode priority bits (SPN 897).  A zero torque request to the retarder is a disable request, and is used by a J1939 node to prevent the retarder from being activated by other combinations of inputs outside of J1939 commands. The Torque Limit Mode is commonly used for this purpose.|1 byte|1 %/bit|-125 %|-125 to 125 %|0 to 125% engine torque requests, -125% to 0% for retarder torque requests|%
